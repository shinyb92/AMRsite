    			<h2>About Us</h2>
 
    					<p>At Associated Material Resource we have three main goals:   Save our customers money while providing the highest quality materials with unmatched service.  As a supplier of raw plastic materials it is vital to succeed in all three areas.

							With experience since 1984 in engineering  and commodity thermoplastics, as well as  thermoset plastics, our customers benefit from our knowledge and expertise.  Many things have changed over the last 30+ years there are new materials and processes that many couldn't have been imagined.  What hasn't changed is (a) The need for plastics processors to increase profits by saving money (b) The need for high quality raw materials, free of contaminants,  and (c) The need for timely delivery and technical support.
							We would love to hear from you and welcome any feedback and comments.  Please feel free to use our "Contact Us" tab to tell us what we're doing right or what we can improve on.
